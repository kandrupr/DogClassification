## What's That Dog

Image classifcation of dogs to 120 different breeds

### Installing 
What we are using 
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) Deep Learning Package
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Machine Learning package and backend for Keras

Python Scripts to clean data.
Jupyter Notebook to build model. Since we are using Jupter Notebook, it is easiest to get all package dependences by running: 
```
conda install keras
```
### Progress
Basic model in place with bad results. With the lack of GPUs, looking to AWS to build a model for faster and better results...
